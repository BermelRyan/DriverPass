# DriverPass
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client DriverPass wanted a system to help new drivers pass their driving tests by providing online tests and assisted courses. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I think I did well in was the overall system designing process and the breakdown of what was needed for it to work.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would chose the functional and non-functional aspects. I would improve this by getting useful feedback from users to improve areas that are giving the most trouble.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I wanted to ensure that I broke down the system and implemented every part of the system that the client wanted. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing as the more a client is satified they would come back to you if they wanted another system to be designed. And at the end of the day, it's their system so they should be happy with the system that they desired.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The strategy that I would use in the future would be to breakdown the system into smaller parts and tackle them one at a time and make sure that it all works before moving on to the next step.
